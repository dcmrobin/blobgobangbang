Yeah I know, silly name, but still.<br>
It's a multiplayer first person shooter.<br>
Thanks to Unity (for it's fps stater kit: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/fps-microgame-156015)<br>
and Photon (for it's multiplayer stuff: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/pun-2-free-119922)<br>
I made a multiplayer fps! It's a bit buggy,(for example, if a player shoots the other player, the player<br>that shot get's hurt) but it's still multiplayer.
